# alien_invasion

Hello! Welcome to Alien Invasion, a simple Space Invaders clone game in Python (one day I'll rename it to Morph Invasion).

I created this game following the first project from the excellent book Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes (2nd edition, 2019, page 225.).

The scripts contain all the notes that I made during my coding sessions, I hope you find them helpfull. If not, ignore them.

I made several modifications, including:

- Added custom music and sound effects created by Vincent Ligny. You can check him out on instagram:

- Added custom images for the ship and aliens.
- Changed background color.
- Changed UI color.
- Added a Game Over button once the player ship fleet is depleted.
- Modified bullet size and speed.
- Changed the speed increment of several game objects after each alien fleet is destroyed.

I plan on making other changes to the game, including ading a menu at the start.
These changes will be added to the list as soon as they are made.

Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or questons about the game.

Happy coding!
